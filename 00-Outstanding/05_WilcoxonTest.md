Why did I use the WT and SWT for MDs and Strides?

* WT : Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
* SWT : Shapiro Wilk Test 

#### Discusson


A key assumption of the paired t-test is the normal distribution of the population of case-wise differences. This assumption may be validated by standard tests of normality, such as the Shapiro-Wilk Test. However, the procedure is known to be robust to violation of this assumption (1). An supplementary method is to examine the data with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the non-parametric analogue of the paired t-test (2). Using both procedures together adds a greater degree of clarity about the outcome of the analysis. All three procedures are easily implementable in statistical software.
