This module will provide a student with a solid understanding of the main
issues in the design and interpretation of clinical trials. The module will outline
the fundamental principles of comparative clinical trials in investigating
effectiveness, efficacy and safety of treatments; and compare the benefits of
clinical trials in comparison to alternative study designs. The main features of
clinical trials, including methodological and organisational considerations, and
the principles of trial conduct and reporting will be described. Key decisions
surrounding design (including sample size), delivery and assessment of clinical
trials will be explored.
