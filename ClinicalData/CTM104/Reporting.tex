%================================================================================%
This module will cover writing up completed trials, including guidelines for
authors (such as the CONSORT Statements for reporting), as well as guidelines
for readers to aid their critical appraisal of trial reports. Since future policy,
practice and further research will ideally be guided by the reports not merely
of one trial but by the totality of the evidence, a major component of the
module will be the role of systematic reviews; how to critically read a
systematic review and explain the processes necessary to do a high quality
review (including deciding whether a meta-analysis is appropriate).

%================================================================================%
The module is expected to include sessions addressing the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to Reporting and Reviewing Clinical Trials
\item Critical Appraisal of a Clinical Trial Report
\item Title, Abstract and Background for a Clinical Trial Report
\item Methods for a Clinical Trial Report

\item Introduction to Systematic Reviews. Why Do We Need Them and What Do
They Do?
