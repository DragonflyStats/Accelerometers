Instantaneous loading rate is another term for JERK. This is the 3rd differentiation of position wrt time (position-velocity-acceleration-jerk).

I'd like to do some analyses of the jerk data as I've given it a lot of space in the lit review. 

That table was simply a line chart of pre and post jerk values. 

#### Jerk 

A deeper analysis of jerk, is one.

Also I'd started to write a chapter (I'm sure its drivel, but perhaps interesting in my world) on applying data analysis techniques to running data as a means of incorporating some of the illustrations KH had pulled together (as per the attached).  

Are there a couple of illustration (accompanied by some data) that could, in a quick and dirty way, punctuate some key messages relating to

 *   how peak accels change thro the different sensors at diff locations (i.e. what I may prev have called stiffness or shock attenuation)
*    how stride times change
*    how variability (of accels or jerk) changes over the time series
