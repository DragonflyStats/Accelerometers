Instantaneous loading rate is another term for JERK. This is the 3rd differentiation of position wrt time (position-velocity-acceleration-jerk).

I'd like to do some analyses of the jerk data as I've given it a lot of space in the lit review. We mentioned it on friday, but didn't discuss it much as you, rightly, wanted to focus on one job at a time.

That table was simply a line chart of pre and post jerk values.
