Conclusion

Testing the Sample Entropy.

We test differences on both legs, classified as dominant and non-dominant, before and after treatment.

We anaylses the paired differences for both legs separately, using the standard paired t-test,  and then jointly 
using multivariate methods.

Using paired We find that there is a significant difference for the dominant leg. but no significant for the non-dominant leg.
