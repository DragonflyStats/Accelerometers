%	\item For example, for the European Union Structure of Earnings
%	Statistics a second scenario based on an additional key varibles is of interest to
%	look at. e.g. occupation might be considered  well as an categorical key variable.
%	\item The resulting risk might now be higher than for the previous scenario. It needs
%	discussion with subject matter specialists which scenario is most realistic and an
%	evaluation of different scenarios helps to get a broader picture about the disclosure

\subsection*{Population Frequencies and the Individual Risk Appoach}
\begin{frame}	
	\frametitle{Population Frequencies}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
	\item Typically, risk evaluation is based on the concept of uniqueness in the sample
	and / or in the population. The focus is on individual units that possess rare com	binations of selected key variables.
	\item The assumption is that units having rare
	combinations of key variables can be more easily identiﬁed and thus have a higher
	risk of re-identiﬁcation/disclosure. 
	\item It is possible to cross-tabulate all identifying
	variables and view their cast. 
	\item Keys possessed by only very few individuals are
	considered risky, especially if these observations also have small sampling weights.
	This means that the expected number of individuals with these patterns is expected to be low in the population as well.

\begin{frame}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To assess whether a unit is at risk, a threshold approach is typically used. If the
	risk of re—identiﬁcation for an individual is above a certain threshold value, the unit
	is said to be at risk. 
	\item To compute individual risks, it is necessary to estimate the
	frequency of a given key pattern in the population. 
	
	\item Let us deﬁne frequency counts
	in a mathematical notation. Consider a random sample of size n drawn from a
	ﬁnite population of size N. Let $\pi_j$, $j = 1, \ldots ,N$ be the (ﬁrst order) inclusion
	probabilities — the probability that element $u_j$ of a population of the size N is
	chosen in a sample of size n.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item All possible combinations of categories in the key variables (i.e., keys or patterns)
	can be calculated by cross-tabulation of these variables.
	\item Let $f_i$, $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ be
	the frequency counts obtained by cross-tabulation and let $F_i$ be the frequency
	counts of the population which belong to the same pattern. 
	\item If $f_i=1$ applies,
	the corresponding observation is unique in the sample given the key-variables. If
	\item If $F_i = 1$, then the observation is unique in the population  well and automatically
	unique or zero in the sample.
	%----------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\item $F_i$ is usually not known, since, in statistics, information on samples is collected
	to make inferences about populations.

\begin{itemize}
	\item In Table 1 a very simple data set is used to explain the calulation of sample
	frequency counts and the (first rough) estimation of population frequency counts.
	One can easily see that observation 1 and 8 are equal, given the key-variables Age
	Class , Location, Sex and Education. Because the values of observations 1 and
	8 are equal and therefore the sample frequency counts are $f_1=2$ and $f_8=2$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Estimated population frequencies are obtained by summing up the sample weights
	for equal observations. 
	\item Population frequencies $\hat{F}_1$ and $\hat{F}_8$ can then be estimated
	by summation over the corresponding sampling weights, $w_1$ and $w_8$. 
	\item In summary,
	two observations with the pattern (key) (1,2,5, 1) exist in the sample and 110
	observations with this pattern (key) can be expected to exist in the population.

	\item One can show, however, that these estimates almost always overestimate small
	population frequency counts .
	%see, e.g., Templ and l\leill<ll, 2010].
	
	\item A better approach is to use so-called super—population models, in which population frequency
	counts are modeled given certain distributions. 
	
	\item For example, the estimation procedure of sample counts given the population counts can be modeled by assuming
	a negative binomial distribution and is implemented
	in \textbf{sdcMicro} in function \texttt{measurelisk()}
	and called by the
	\textbf{sdcMicroGUI}.
