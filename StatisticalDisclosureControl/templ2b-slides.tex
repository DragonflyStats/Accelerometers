		\frametitle{Measuring Risk : k-anonymity}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Based on a set of key variables, one desired characteristic of a protected micro
		dataset is often to achieve \textbf{k-anonymity} 
		%[Samarati and Sweeney, 1998, Sarnarati,2001, Swwriey, 2002]. 
		\item This means that each possible pattern of key variables con-
		tains at least k units in the microdata. This is equal to $f_i \geq k, i=1,2,3,\ldots ,n$.  A
		typical value is k = 3.
		\item k—anonymity is typically achieved by recoding categorical key variables into fewer
		categories and by suppressing speciﬁc values of key variables for some units;
		\end{itemize}
		% see Section 3.1 and 3.2.

\frametitle{Measuring Risk : l-diversity}
\begin{itemize}	
	\item An extension of k-anonymity is l-diversity. Consider
		a group of observations with the same pattern/keys in the key variables and let
		the group fulfill k-anonymity. \item A data intruder can therefore by definition not
		identify an individual within this group. 
		\item If all observations have the same entries
		in an additional sensitive variable. however (e.g., cancer in the variable medical
		diagnosis), an attack will be successful if the attacker can identify at least one
		individual of the group, as the attacker knows that this individual has cancer
		with certainty. 
		\item The distribution of the target-sensitive variable is referred to as
		l-diversity.

	\begin{itemize}
 \item		Table 2 considers a small example dataset that highlights the calculations of
		l-diversity.
		\item  It also points out the slight difference compared to k-anonymity. The
		ﬁrst two columns present the categorical key variables. 
		\item The third column of the
		data deﬁnes a variable containing sensitive information. 
		\end{itemize}
		\end{frame}

		%======================================================%
		\begin{frame}	
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Sample frequency counts $f_i$ appear in the fourth column. They equal 3 for the ﬁrst three observations; the
		fourth observation is unique and frequency counts $f_i$ are 2 for the last two observations. 
		\item Only the fourth observation violates 2-anonymity. Looking closer at the ﬁrst
		three observations, we see that only two different values are present in the sensitive
		variable. 
		\item Thus the l-(distinct) diversity is just 2. 
		\end{itemize}

	\end{frame}
	%======================================================%
	\begin{frame}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item For the last two observations,
		2-anonymity is achieved, but the intruder still knows the exact information of the
		sensitive variable. \item For these observations, the l-diversity measure is 1. indicating
		that sensitive information can be disclosed, since the value of the sensitive variable
		is = 62 for both of these observations.

		\begin{itemize}
		\item Diversity in values of sensitive variables can be measured differently. We present
		here the distinct diversity that counts how many different values exist within a
		pattern.

		\frametitle{Special Uniques Detection Algorithm (SUDA)}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item The \textbf{Special Uniques Detection Algorithm (SUDA)} is an often discussed method
		to estimate the risk, but applications of this method can be rarely found. 
		\item For
		the sake of completeness this algorithm is implemented in sdcMicro (but not in
		sdcMicroGUI) and explained in this document, but to evaluate the usefulness of
		this method it needs more research. 
		
		\item In the following the interested reader will
		see that the SUDA approach is more than the sample frequency estimation shown
		before. 
		\item It consider also subsets of key variables. SUDA estimates disclosure risks
		for each unit. SUDA2  is the computationally improved
		version of SUDA.

		\frametitle{SUDA2}
		It is a recursive algorithm to find \textbf{\textit{Minimal Sample Uniques}}
		(MSUs). SUDA2 generates all possible variable subsets of selected categorical key
		variables and scans for unique patterns within subsets of these variables. The risk
		of an observation primarily depends on two aspects:
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[(a)] The lower the number of variables needed to receive uniqueness, the higher
			the risk (and the higher the SUDA score) of the corresponding observation.
			\item[(b)] The larger the number of minimal sample uniqueness contained within an
			observation, the higher the risk of this observation.
		\end{itemize}

		%======================================================%
	\begin{frame}
		
		In this formula, m corresponds to the depth, which is the max-
		imum size of variable subsets of the key variables, \textit{MSUmin}$_i$, is the number of
		MSUs of observation and i and n are the number of observations of the dataset.
		%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Since each observation is treated independently, a speciﬁc value 1,; belonging to a
			speciﬁc pattern are summed up. This results in a common SUDA score for each
			of the observations contained in this pattern; this summation is the contribution
			mentioned in item 
			\item The final SUDA score is calculated by normalizing these SUDA scores by dividing them by pl, with p being the number of key variables.

		\begin{itemize} 
			\item To receive the so-called
			\textbf{Data Intrusion Simulation (DIS) score}, loosely speaking, an iterative algorithm
			based on sampling of the data and matching of subsets of the sampled data with
			the original data is applied. 
			\item This algorithm calculates the probabilities of correct
			matches given unique matches. It is, however, out of scope to precisely describe
			this algorithm here. %reference Fllliot [2000] for details.

					\begin{itemize} 
			\item The DIS SUDA score is calculated from the SUDA and DIS scores, and is available in \textbf{sdcMicro} as \texttt{disScore()}.
			\item Note that this method does not consider population frequencies in general, but
			does consider sample frequencies on subsets. 
			\item The DIS SUDA scores approximate
			uniqueness by simulation based on the sample information population, but to our
			knowledge, they generally do not consider sampling weights, and biased estimates
			may therefore result.

			\item The
			SUDA scores have the largest value for observation 4 and 6 since subsets of key
			variables of these observation are also unique, while for observations 1 — 3, 5 and
			8, less subsets are unique.

		\frametitle{Calculating Cluster (Household) Risks}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Micro datasets often contain hierarchical cluster structures; an example is social
			surveys, when individuals are clustered in households. 
			\item The risk of re-identifying
			an individual within a household may also affect the probability of disclosure of
			other members in the same household. Thus, the household or cluster-structure of
			the data must be taken into account when calculating risks.
\end{itemize}

	%======================================================%
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Calculating Cluster (Household) Risks}
		\begin{itemize}			
			\item It is commonly assumed that the risk of re-identﬁcation of a household is the risk
			that at least one member of the household can be disclosed. Thus this probability
			can be simply estimated from individual risks as 1 minus the probability that no
			member of the household can be identﬁed. 
			\item Thus, if we consider a single household
			with three persons that have individual risks of re-identiﬁcation of 0.1, 0.05 and
			0.01, respectively, the risk-measure for the entire household will be calculated as
			1-(0.1+0.05+0.01). 
			\item This is also the implementation strategy from \textbf{sdcMicro}.
