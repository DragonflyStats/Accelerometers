Rationale:

A single measure to detect a change an overall change in each athlete before and after fatigue treatment.
We have multiple Measurement Variables, what we require is a single statistic that aggregrates the information in these variables, while 
respecting the scale of measurement for each variable, and the inherent covariance between them.
The method should be easily computable and reasonably interpretable for non-statisticians.


Required:
* Simple Description of a Mahalanobis Distance (Mathematical)
* Graphic - Can generate one using R.
