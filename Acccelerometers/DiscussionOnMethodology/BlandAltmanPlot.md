The reason is that plots are very simple to create and use this approach for comparing two methods of measurement.

Historically comparison of two methods of measurement was carried out by use of paired 
sample $t-$test, correlation coefficients or simple bivariate methods. Statisticians Martin Bland and Douglas Altman 
recognized the inadequacies of these approaches for comparing two methods of measurement, and proposed their own framework with 
this application in mind \citep{BA83,BA86}. Although the authors acknowledge the opportunity to apply other, more complex approaches, 
they argue that simpler approaches are preferable, especially when the results must be `explained to non-statisticians'.
