To precede the stuff on mahalanobis distances - a short paragraph on what multivariate statistics are would be handy

The files you sent me are multivariate - but we are analysing them individually (univariate approaches)
A lof of vital information goes missing.

In the summary - argue for a greater adoption and understanding of multivariate statistics - so that information about correlations between variables and how they change is better understood.
