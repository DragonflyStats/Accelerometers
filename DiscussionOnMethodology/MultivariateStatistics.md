To precede the stuff on mahalanobis distances - a short paragraph on what multivariate statistics are would be handy

The files you sent me are multivariate - but we are analysing them individually (univariate approaches)
A lof of vital information goes missing.

In the summary - argue for a greater adoption and understanding of multivariate statistics - so that information about correlations between variables and how they change is better understood.



### Univariate V’s Multivariate analysis

The purpose of univariate analysis is to ‘describe’. Using univariate analysis, changes to one variable, and one variable only, are detailed. Essentially univariate analysis can summarise, and find patterns existing within that specific data stream. Univariate analysis cannot, however, unravel the changing inter-relationships between distinct co-modulating variables (???). 

Multivariate analytical approaches, in contrast, can consider more than one dependent variable, and subsequently can be used to identify potential associations, correlations and interactions between 3 or more simultaneously modulating variables. 

In a running context, whereby complex, dynamic, structured and cyclical streams of information are persistently and mutually co-modulating, univariate analysis provides a very limited window into the underlying nature of coordination patterns.  Multivariate analysis, in contrast, offers a more insightful conceptual lens through which to investigate the underlying nature of running coordination.
